## Description
The objective of the 'world-happiness' project, by brimless-yankee, is to primarily look for patterns relating 'happiness' levels by nation with a number of other indicators; including concentration of top-ranked institutions of higher learning, GDP per capita, total number of terrorist incidents, and so on. brimless-yankee aims to use D3.js to visualize our findings, and we hope that through this project, we are able to see what contributes to the happiness of a country's population.
